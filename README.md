Welcome to the Employee Attendance Insights project! In this repository, I present a comprehensive overview of how we've gathered, transformed, and analyzed employee attendance data over a three-month period. My goal is to create meaningful metrics and visualizations, providing a valuable resource for workforce management decisions.

Data Collection and Transformation
Utilizing the robust capabilities of Power Query in Power BI, I collected and transformed data from multiple Excel sheets with varying column headers. The focus was on capturing employee names, dates, and attendance key codes, such as 'PL' for paid leave and 'SL' for sick leave. This process ensured a standardized and consolidated dataset ready for insightful analysis.

Metrics Creation with DAX
Diving into the analytics realm, we leveraged Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create key metrics. The initial metrics include the '% of Work from Home' and the '% of Sick Leave.' However, the flexibility of DAX allows for the incorporation of additional metrics, providing stakeholders with a richer understanding of employee attendance trends.

Dashboard Creation
The final and perhaps most exciting step is the creation of a dynamic dashboard. Using the processed data and insights gained from the metrics, I designed a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard serves as a one-stop hub for stakeholders to effortlessly explore and interpret attendance patterns, helping in strategic decision-making.
