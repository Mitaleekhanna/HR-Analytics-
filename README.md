I got the data of 3 months and in the columns we have the dates and in the rows we have employee names.You can also see attendance key codes. So there are codes like PL means paid leave, SL means sick leaves and these codes are present in the cells, in in the excel file.I gathered and transformed the data using Power Query. Power Query is a feature in Power BI which will help to collect and transform the data the way you want. The data is in excel and in multiple sheets with different column headers. Then I created metrics using DAX. The first metric I created is the % of ‘Work from Home. The second one is the ‘% of sick leave’. But there are more, we can add more value by helping the stakeholders to discover more metrics. Final step - the fun part is to create a Dashboard
